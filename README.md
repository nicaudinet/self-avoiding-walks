# Self-Avoiding Walks

A [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news) implementation of a self-avoiding space-filling walk. Inspiration taken from the great [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6-cm6GZ1iw) YouTube channel.

To run you need Python with PyGame installed and then:

```
python self-avoiding-walk.py
```

The repo comes also with a minimal Nix shell with Python and pygame for Nix users.
